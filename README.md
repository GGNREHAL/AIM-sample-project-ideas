## Pose Estimation

Pose Estimation is the task of using Computer Vision techniques to predict and track the location of key features of a person or object in an image or video. As part of the project, your system must take in an image or a sequence of video frames, calculating the estimated position of a human body.

You must use a self-contained Jupyter Notebook to deliver this project, with clear markdown cells describing your work.

### As part of your final delivery - you must submit

- The source code for your application and a notebook documenting your work and techniques used.
- A pre-trained Pytorch model.
- Your notebook must include code which loads the pre-trained model, preprocesses a given image or video and display the estimated pose.

### Dataset

Below are some sample datasets that you can use to train your model. Of course, you may use other datasets (Please discuss with your lecturer).

## Neural Denoiser

Neural Denoiser is a class of machine learning algorithms which commonly use supervised learning to reduce noise in a given image or video. In the visual effects industry, it is used to reconstruct image sequences rendered using traditional Light transport techniques with low sampling.

### As part of your final delivery - you must submit

- The source code for your application and a notebook documenting your work and techniques used.
- A pre-trained Pytorch model.
- Your notebook must include code which loads the pre-trained model, preprocesses a given image or video and display the estimated pose.

### Dataset

Below are some sample datasets you can use to train your model. Of course, you may use other datasets or create your own (Please discuss with your lecturer).

## AI Upscaling / Super Resolution

AI Upscaling is the process of converting lower resolution media to a higher resolution. In a supervisor manner, Neural-based approaches train a model to predict a high-resolution image or sequence of images.

### As part of your final delivery - you must submit

- The source code for your application and a notebook documenting your work and techniques used.
- A pre-trained Pytorch model.
- Your notebook must include code which loads the pre-trained model, preprocesses a given image or video and display the estimated pose.

## Object Segmentation

Object segmentation is the process of applying a label to every pixel in the image, for example, isolating a subject in a photo taken by a smartphone and applying a blur to the background to recreate the notion of depth-of-field. You should not mistake this for object detection.

### As part of your final delivery - you must submit

- The source code for your application and a notebook documenting your work and techniques used.
- A pre-trained Pytorch model.
- Your notebook must include code which loads the pre-trained model, preprocesses a given image or video and display the estimated pose.
